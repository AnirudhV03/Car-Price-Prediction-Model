# Car-Price-Prediction-Model
🚗 Car Price Prediction ML Model 📈

In this project, I harnessed the power of Machine Learning with a focus on Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost Regression to create an accurate, versatile, and data-driven tool for predicting car prices.

📊 Key Features:

**Accurate Valuations:** Say goodbye to guesswork. My model provides precise price estimates based on key car attributes like make, model, year, mileage, and more.

**Versatile Algorithms:** By leveraging the strengths of Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost Regression, we ensure comprehensive analysis and robust predictions.

D**ata-Driven Decisions**: Whether you're buying, selling, or simply curious, this tool empowers you with insights to make informed decisions about car investments.

🛠️ Under the Hood:

**Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming data to ensure optimal model performance.
**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning model settings to enhance accuracy.
**Model Evaluation:** Rigorous evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to ensure reliable predictions.
