# Car-Price-Prediction-Model
🚗 Car Price Prediction ML Model 📈

In this endeavour, I harnessed the power of Machine Learning with a focus on Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost Regression to create an accurate, versatile, and data-driven tool for predicting car prices.

📊 Key Features:

Accurate Valuations: Say goodbye to guesswork. My model provides precise price estimates based on key car attributes like make, model, year, mileage, and more.

Versatile Algorithms: By leveraging the strengths of Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost Regression, we ensure comprehensive analysis and robust predictions.

Data-Driven Decisions: Whether you're buying, selling, or simply curious, this tool empowers you with insights to make informed decisions about car investments.

Model Comparison: I've fine-tuned and compared various algorithms to offer you the most accurate and reliable results.

User-Friendly Interface: The model comes with an intuitive interface for ease of use, making it accessible to anyone interested in car pricing.

🛠️ Under the Hood:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming data to ensure optimal model performance.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning model settings to enhance accuracy.
Model Evaluation: Rigorous evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R-squared to ensure reliable predictions.
